 * 
 * Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the
 * tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path
 * between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the
 * root.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Given a binary tree 
 * 
 * ⁠         1
 * ⁠        / \
 * ⁠       2   3
 * ⁠      / \     
 * ⁠     4   5    
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
 * between them.
